# FreeCodeCamp-challenges
A repo for all the code that I have written to pass the challenges from FreeCodeCamp.

1. Reverse strings:
The overall idea of the code is to take a string with any content in it, pass it as the argument of the function and receive as a result another string but reversed. For example a string "Hello" comes back as "olleH".

This function works for phrases which include spaces between each word too.

2. Biggest-number-in-each-Array:
This code takes the biggest number from a bidimensional Array an return them as a new Array
