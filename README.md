# FCC-challenges
A repo for all the code that I have written to pass the challenges from FreeCodeCamp.

1. Reverse strings:
The overall idea of the code is to take a string with any content in it, pass it as the argument of the function and receive as a result another string but reversed. For example a string "Hello" comes back as "olleH".

This function works for phrases which include spaces between each word too.

2. Biggest-number-in-each-Array:
This code takes the biggest number from a bidimensional Array an return them as a new Array.

3. General-Factorial-function:
This is a function that takes a number as a parameter, pass it as the argument of said function and returns the factorial version of said number. A factorialize number if one that is equal to the product of said number with each of its predecessors until it multiplies by 1. For example 5! = 5*4*3*2*1= 120.

4. Largest-Number-in-an-Array:
Code that returns back the highest number contained in an Array, regardless of this being multidimensional.

5. The-Length-of-the-longest-word-in-a-String:
This code passes a string into a function and returns back the ".length" of the longest word in said string.

6. Confirm-Ending.
This code takes two strings as parameter "str" and "target". transform them into arrays in which each letter of the strings through .match becomes an individual element of the new arrays. The end of "str" is use to build a new array with the same amount of elements that appear in "target" afterward this new array is inverted to match "target", the contents of this new array are past as a string and this string is compared to the string "target", if they match returns "true", otherwise returns "false".

7. Repeat a String Repeat a String:
This code takes a string "str" and returns it a number of times(num).
For num equal to zero or below returns and empty string "".

8. Truncate a String:
Reduce a string(str) to a length(num) and adds "..." to the end of the new truncated string, if said number is minor than the length of the string; if the number is equal or bigger return the whole untouched string.

9. Title Case a Sentence:
Code which takes an string and returns back a string with the first letter of each word capitalized and rest in lower case.
This functions works with multiword strings, space between words and apostrophes.

10. Title Case a Sentence:
Function that copies the contents of one array into another from the index n.

11. Falsy Bouncer:
A function that filters out falsy elements out of one dimensional arrays.

12. Where do I Belong:
A function that takes an array and its contents(only numbers) and reorder them from minor to greater, compares these values with its second parameter and determinates which value in the index is greater than or equal to it, returns back the index of the latter.

13. Mutations:
A function that takes an array with two sub-arrays containing strings and compares them.
If all the letters of the second array match the ones in the first one return 'True', otherwise 'False'.
The code takes uppercase and lowercase letters as the same.

14. Chunky Monkey:
A function that takes an array(parameter) and splits it into subarrays with a length equal to the parameter "size".

15. Apply Functional Programming to Convert Strings to URL Slugs(Functional Programming):
A function that takes a String and returns a new one which replace the espaces for hyphens
